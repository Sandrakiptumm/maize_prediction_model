    "# **Business Understanding for Maize Price Prediction Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Objective**\n",
    "The central focus of the project is the development of a predictive model that will be able to forecast the wholesale and retail prices of maize within different markets in Kenya, based on the historical data from the prices of maize and related factors. It will thereby allow for accurate forecasts of the prices that will assist key stakeholders within the maize supply chains, such as farmers, traders, and policymakers, in making relevant decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Key Stakeholders**\n",
    "- **Farmers**: To optimize when to sell their maize based on expected future prices.\n",
    "- **Traders**: To plan their buying and selling strategies and improve profitability.\n",
    "- **Policymakers**: To inform policy decisions aimed at ensuring food security and stabilizing market prices.\n",
    "- **Suppliers and Distributors**: To manage stock levels and plan supply chain logistics effectively.\n",
    "- **Retailers**: To predict retail prices, helping them manage inventory and sales strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Business Problem**\n",
    "The fluctuations of maize price directly create impacts on the changes in Kenyan economic and food security conditions. Conditions like seasonality, supply volume, and market location and classification of different types of maize such as yellow, white amongst others drive the fluctuation. But it is hard to predict price changes of maize due to a change in an agricultural market or outside factors associated with weather condition or policy amendment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inability to forecast maize prices accurately results in:\n",
    "- Uncertainty in income for farmers.\n",
    "- exploitation of farmers\n",
    "- Price volatility for consumers.\n",
    "- Inefficient stock management for traders and suppliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "By predicting prices accurately, stakeholders can mitigate risks, optimize profit margins, and contribute to the stability of the maize market.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Current Situation**\n",
    "Currently, the maize market operates with limited forward-looking insights. Most pricing decisions are made based on historical prices, intuition, or delayed market reports. This has led to:\n",
    "- **Price rises or drops**, negatively affecting both farmers and consumers.\n",
    "- **Supply chain inefficiencies** caused by unanticipated demand-supply imbalances.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Expected Benefits**\n",
    "- **For Farmers**: Improved decision-making for when to sell maize, optimizing profit margins.\n",
    "- **For Traders and Distributors**: Efficient stock management, reducing losses from oversupply or undersupply.\n",
    "- **For Policymakers**: Better policy formulation and food security planning.\n",
    "- **For Retailers**: Pricing strategies that minimize losses and increase profitability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Scope of the Model**\n",
    "The model will predict the wholesale and retail prices of maize using key input variables:\n",
    "- **Date** (to capture seasonality and trends over time).\n",
    "- **Supply Volume** (to reflect how the quantity of maize brought to the market affects prices).\n",
    "- **County** (to capture regional price differences).\n",
    "- **Market** (to account for market-specific variations).\n",
    "- **Classification** (to distinguish between types of maize, e.g., yellow and white maize).\n",
    "\n",
    "This model will be trained on historical data, considering seasonality, trend, and all other market factors. It may be used in price forecasting at wholesale and retail marketplaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Data Sources**\n",
    "The primary data source is the **Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development's AMIS website**, which provides detailed information on:\n",
    "- Maize commodity prices (wholesale and retail)\n",
    "- Classification (yellow or white maize)\n",
    "- Supply volume\n",
    "- Market and county location\n",
    "- Dates and other relevant time-based data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **Challenges and Risks**\n",
    "- **Data Gaps**: Missing data for certain markets, maize types, or time periods may affect the accuracy of predictions. Data imputation techniques (like `bfill`, `ffill`, and KNN) will be used to mitigate this.\n",
    "- **Price Volatility**: Sudden external factors, such as weather changes or government interventions, could cause price changes that are hard to predict.\n",
    "- **Seasonality**: Maize prices are highly seasonal, and capturing this with sufficient precision is essential for accurate forecasting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. **Model Output**\n",
    "The model will output predictions for:\n",
    "- **Wholesale prices**,\n",
    "- **Retail prices**.\n",
    "\n",
    "These predictions will be available for a given future date and specific locations/markets across Kenya.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. **Future Considerations**\n",
    "- **Expansion to Other Crops**: The model could be adapted to predict prices for other staple crops, provided relevant data is available.\n",
    "- **Improvement in Accuracy**: By incorporating additional data, such as weather patterns, government interventions, or global commodity prices, the model’s accuracy could be further enhanced.\n",

    "# **Data Understanding for Maize Price Prediction Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Overview of the Dataset**\n",
    "The dataset for the maize price prediction model has been sourced from the **Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development's AMIS** website. It contains information about maize prices in various markets across Kenya. The data includes several key features that are expected to influence maize prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Key Features in the Dataset**\n",
    "The dataset consists of the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Date**: The date of the record. This field is of utmost importance since it might be able to capture temporal patterns, trends, and seasonality in the prices.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Commodity**: This is the name of the product, in this case, the crop maize. The commodity field does not really add much variability for the current model since the focus would be on maize; it could be useful in further applications to extend it for other crops.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Classification**: Maize class. Example: Yellow Maize, White Maize. This is a categorical feature, which helps in differentiating the price pattern for different types of maize.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Market**:  The market in which the price of maize was recorded. This feature would account for geographical variation in prices recorded, due to differences in demand and supply within different markets.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **County**:  County of sale location of the market. County level data accounts for regional factors such as transport cost and demand which drive price setting.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Wholesale Price**: The wholesale price of maize. This is one of the main target variables that will be forecasted by the model.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Retail Price**: This is the amount paid by consumers for maize. This is the second target variable to be forecasted.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Supply Volume**: The amount of maize brought to the market, which directly impacts price movements. A higher supply typically reduces prices, while lower supply may increase prices.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Other Time Features**: In addition to the raw date, several engineered time features are included:\n",
    "  - **Day**, **Month**, **Year**: These capture the specific day, month, and year of each record.\n",
    "  - **Day_sin**, **Day_cos**, **Month_sin**, **Month_cos**, **Year_sin**, **Year_cos**: These are cyclic transformations of day, month, and year to help capture seasonality patterns and cyclical trends in maize prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Data Types**\n",
    "- **Numerical Features**:\n",
    "  - **Wholesale Price**: Continuous, float.\n",
    "  - **Retail Price**: Continuous, float.\n",
    "  - **Supply Volume**: Continuous, float.\n",
    "  - **Time Features**: Discrete (Day, Month, Year) and continuous (sin/cos transformations).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Categorical Features** (One-hot Encoded):\n",
    "  - **Classification**\n",
    "  - **Market**\n",
    "  - **County**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Data Quality**\n",
    "#### **Missing Values**\n",
    "- Missing values are present in the dataset, particularly in the **Wholesale**, **Retail**, and **Supply Volume** columns. Several imputation strategies have been considered:\n",
    "  - **Backward Fill (`bfill`)**: Filling missing values with the next valid value in the column.\n",
    "  - **Forward Fill (`ffill`)**: Filling missing values with the last valid value in the column.\n",
    "  - **KNN Imputation**: Using K-Nearest Neighbors to impute missing values based on similarity in other features.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  The approach to be used depends on the data distribution and model performance after each technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Outliers**\n",
    "- **Wholesale and Retail Prices**: Outliers in price data may occur due to exceptional circumstances (e.g., price spikes due to drought or political interventions). \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Supply Volume**: Sudden, extreme variations in supply volume may need to be analyzed \n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Feature Engineering**\n",
    "To enhance the predictive power of the model, several engineered features have been created:\n",
    "- **Rolling Means and Standard Deviations**: 7-day rolling means and standard deviations for **Wholesale Price**, **Retail Price**, and **Supply Volume**. These features help smooth out short-term fluctuations and provide a clearer view of price trends.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Lagged Features**: Lag features for **Supply Volume** and prices help capture the delayed effects of supply changes on prices.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Binary Encoding**: For categorical variables like **Classification**, **Market**, and **County**, to ensure they can be properly utilized in machine learning algorithms.\n",
